# CarRepairTracker
This is a group project by Triston and Justin, 2 Clover Park Technical college students.


# About this app
Upon completion, this app will function to serve as a vehicle repair tracker. Users will be able to select a make and model of a JDM vehicle from years
2016 and up, and add each service that is done to that one specific vehicle

# Getting started
This program is written in c# and uses the entity framework core for the database side of things. 
For starters, you need [.NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

You must also install these Nuget Packages: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer, and Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
from the Nuget package manager.

Once everything is properly installed, make sure to use code first migrations on your end. (Add-Migration "......" and Update-Database are the commands you will want to use.
